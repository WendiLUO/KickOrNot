# KickOrNot
“Kick” Predictor — Data mining, data analysis, course team project   
Partnered with a teammate to apply machine learning techniques and models to predict if the car purchased at the 
Auction is a Kick (bad buy) and try to figure out which cars have a higher risk of being “kick”. 
The methodology we applied is to be divided into Feature Engineering, Data Exploration, Data Modeling, and Testing.
